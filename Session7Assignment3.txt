Hive Data Definitions is a subset of Hive SQL statements that describe data structure in Hive by creating, deleting, or altering schema objects like databases, tables, views, partitions and buckets. Examples include primary data: numeric (TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL), string (STRING, VARCHAR, CHAR), date/time (DATE, TIMESTAMP).
Data Manipulations consist of data exchange, order and sort, operators and functions, and transaction. Data exchange can be done with the load function which moves data to the target table or partition thus not existing in its original location. The local key specifies where files are located within the host. Overwrite decides whether to append or replace existing data in a table. Insert function allows you to select data from other tables and place it into another table. Export and import statements allow importing and exporting of data in HDFS for data migration and/or backup and restoration purposes. Order and sort functions allow for data to be arranged so that relevant data points are shown for identity. 
HiveQL data manipulations include insert, overwrite, and select.
